            <p>Anywhere we go, anything we do and everywhere we look involves design. But I’ll ask the question, ‘do we ever really notice?’. When we were given the list of artists for this essay it was so simple for me to decide who to base mine on, his name practically jumped off the page in bold; <strong>‘STEFAN SAGMEISTER’</strong>. For years I have looked at Sagmeister’s work in awe, how he manages to change the graphic design world with his controversial and innovative ideas and how he can capture the audience with his work anywhere he goes. If there is anyone to talk about that’s innovative in design today, it’s him. This takes me back to my question ‘do we ever really notice?’. Sagmeister assures you will as he knows exactly how to get a reaction and make sure you never forget his name.</p>

            <div class="flex-text">

                <p class="item">Austrian born Sagmeister is not only a designer but is also a typographer, studio director and entrepreneur. Although always having a passion for design he took a different path at the beginning of his career by enrolling in an engineering college. He later on decided that this wasn’t for him and followed his real aspirations by joining a graphic design course, all just at the age of 15. Here he helped design for an Austrian magazine named ‘<em>Alphorn</em>’. Later in life he studied at the University of Applied Arts in Vienna and received a scholarship for the Pratt Institute in New York. Throughout his career he has worked with some of the top names in various industries such as the Rolling Stones, HBO and Time Warner. Sagmeister has held exhibitions all over the world to showcase his work in the likes of Vienna, New York and Osaka. Around every seven years Sagmeister doesn’t take any work from clients as he takes a year-long sabbatical to focus on his own work and reinvent himself as a designer.</p>

            <div class="flex-text">


                <p>At 15 Sagmeister jumped at the chance to work with the Alphorn, ‘<em>magazine for the rural area</em>’, editorial team. The team was made up of young designers so he was able to fit right in. He soon realised that the layout of the magazine was where his talents lay and began to voice his inventive ideas to the rest of the team. Unable to express himself through the engineering course, he felt right at home working on the magazine where his creativity could shine. Working with the team was an invaluable learning experience for Sagmeister, particularly for economic reasons. Letrasets were donated but many of the sheets had too many missing letters. To get around this, hand-lettered headlines were created. Sometimes when the budgets were low they had to sew together the magazine when they weren’t able to afford larger printing publications. Most of the time the content and images were such bad quality the publication was actually unreadable. Not only did the magazine allow him to gain design experience but also gave him an insight to design in the real world.</p>

                <h2 id="rightside2">Thesis Project</h2>

                <p>To me, this was really the beginning of the Sagmeister we know today due to the innovation and creativity of the Thesis Project. The 1986 University project consisted of 20 interactive postcards which showed off his ‘taste for tricks and invention’. A triangle was incorporated into the various types of designs and themes. One of the themes was the measurement of time. Sagmeister very cleverly created a postcard that when unfolded would turn into a sundial. However he didn’t just stop there, in fact he made the sundial usable anywhere in the world by giving the option to adjust it to your own individual timezone. This just made the postcard a lot more personal and also allowed him to experiment with design.</p>

                <p>My personal favourite from this project has to be the pop-up record player. When manually operated it actually functions. Other postcards included one that glowed in the dark, another was a magic trick and one created an optical illusion. One of the main aspects I love about Sagmeister’s work is that he creates a lot of really fun pieces without involving any digital components. He understands that the design comes from humans not the machines and tries to express that through each project he undertakes. His impressive use of design through the postcards managed to grab him a prize of $1,000 and a first-class honours degree.</p>

            <img src="img/the4A's.jpg" alt="Call for Entries 1991" id="hong-kong" class="hk flex-image" />

            <div class="flex-text">


                <blockquote>"The approach of one’s 30th birthday can initiate drastic action. John Lennon quit the Beatles. Elizabeth Taylor left her fourth husband for Richard Burton and Liberace dropped his first two names (Wladziu Valentino) to establish himself as a house-hold brand. Stefan Sagmeister, age 29, went to live in Hong Kong."<cite> -Peter Hall.2001.SAGMEISTER Made You Look.Booth-ClibbornEditions</cite></blockquote>

                <p>In 1991 Stefan Sagmeister made the move to Hong Kong where he was offered a position at an ad agency. A few weeks after Sagmeister started working the agency offered him the chance to start the Leo Burnett Hong Kong Design Group. Almost as soon as it was opened there was a steady stream of work coming in from various clients. The Design Group were offered the chance to design a poster for the Advertising Agency Associated Accredited (AAAA). Sagmeister, being the comical genius he is, saw this as an opportunity to stir up trouble. Everything in Hong Kong at that time had to ‘nice and sweet’. Sagmeister wanted to cause some controversy to get people talking and allow his work to stand out from previous posters for the ‘AAAA’.</p>

                <blockquote>“Who’s the asshole who designed this poster?”</blockquote>

                <p>With the title ‘Call for Entries’ Sagmeister and his team managed to produce a rude poster with an unintended innuendo. The poster featured the four men calling on the top half of the poster and on the bottom half showed them bent over with their trousers down. Wanting the bottoms to appear like an original part of the traditional Cantonese style painting, Sagmeister asked a colleague to take a polaroid of him with his trousers down. They then took the image to a ‘painting factory’. A painting factory was where customers could get copies of old paintings and even choose the number of cracks required in a piece.</p>


                <p>Once the poster was complete, the response from the public was pretty predictable. The reaction was so extreme that a design company attending the awards ceremony refused to go, while another tried boycotting the competition. The polite part of the poster was put on the front page of the ‘China Morning Post’ newspaper. Sagmeister claimed there were letters from the editor for weeks including one which read “Who’s the asshole who designed this poster?”. This risky move gained the Leo Burnett huge recognition and the studio found itself busy with plenty of projects. Yet again Sagmeister’s controversy pulled off.</p>

                <blockquote>“It takes bigger balls to open your own place” <cite>-Stefan Sagmeister, 1993 New York studio launch</cite></blockquote>

                <p>1993 was the year Stefan decided to launch his own studio in New York, Sagmeister INC. When it came to designing the invitation of course it couldn't just be a simple RSVP card. Instead Sagmeister, as usual, put his own spin on it. The invite contained two images, both of himself in an office and both with strategically placed tape of different lengths over his naked body. Each image was made to represent the before and after shots of the studio launch. Curious recipients could remove the tape and decide which image they thought had been digitally altered.</p>

            <div class="flex-text">

                <p>Notorious and controversial the 1999 AIGA, American Institute of Graphic Arts, poster gained such wide recognition it is still largely talked about today. Designed for the Detroit group of the AIGA, Sagmeister was asked to create an advertisement for a talk. To me this is Sagmeister’s most influential piece. He proves that when you take a chance it will pay off. Although I’m sure he wouldn’t recommend carving into your own skin, which is exactly what he did to create this poster. Behind every designer there will be times when they have become stressed or anxious, they will have had arguments with colleagues or clients and even pain from the potential loss of a job. Sagmeister wanted to represent all these emotions through his poster.</p>

                <p>On a previous piece named ‘Whereishere’ Stefan experimented carving the short sentence onto his skin. Planning to use this technique, but on a much larger scale, he used his body as a canvas to represent that the human is the designer. This brings it back to a more personal level than designing something on screen. Quickly the issue arose that he would not be able to carve onto his own skin, mostly because he couldn’t carve in reverse. To overcome this he managed to convince one of his colleagues to do it for him, understandably the colleague was reluctant. After eight gruelling hours of pain the poster was finally complete. This piece signalled a real turning point in the design profession. It allowed people to move away from always having digital perfection and instead allow them to express themselves by leaving their own personal mark on their work.</p>

                <p>In 2010 Stefan Sagmeister first met Jessica Walsh. He offered her a job after reviewing her portfolio and in 2012 she became his partner. The pair work well together understanding that they constantly need to reinvent their style. This lives up to Stefan’s motto ‘STYLE = FART’. He claims that style is equivalent to pointless hot air, in other words it means nothing. Now that Sagmeister had a new partner he needed to spread the news. To do this he cleverly decided to recreate his invitation from 1993. Stefan and Jessica both posed naked in their new office to announce the new firm; ‘Sagmeister & Walsh’.</p>

        <section class="p8 light" id="conclusion">



            <p class="item">I constantly ask myself ‘what makes a good designer?’. To me, it is someone who can make anything look nice and follow the brief given. But then I ask myself ‘ what makes a <strong>great</strong> designer?’. Behind every piece of work there must be a message, a meaning. Sagmeister doesn’t just make a project ‘look nice’, instead he takes it a step further allowing his work to have a story behind it. He gives everything to a project, thinking outside the box and coming up with new ways to shock and surprise viewers. He takes chances and doesn’t just do what he’s told. Sagmeister allows me to see that sometimes taking a risk is the best thing you can do. His innovation and creativity outshines so many other designers since doing what he loves means he isn’t afraid to express himself. So when I think of what makes a great designer I look at Stefan Sagmeister and he answers that question for me.</p>
